//! Provides the raw data needed to convert to and from HTML entities.
//!
//! ```edition2021
//! use entities::ENTITIES;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let entity = ENTITIES
//!         .iter()
//!         .find(|e| e.entity == "&gt;")
//!         .unwrap();
//!
//!     assert_eq!(entity.characters, ">");
//!     assert_eq!(entity.entity, "&gt;");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There isn't a 1-to-1 mapping of entities to "characters" which is why this
//! crate provides a flat array rather than a map&mdash;the best way to map the
//! entities depends on the problem _you're_ trying to solve.
//!
//! If you want to create a mapping structure you can make one using static `str`
//! slices to reuse the statically allocated strings from this crate e.g.
//!
//! ```edition2021
//! # use std::collections::HashMap;
//! # use entities::ENTITIES;
//! fn make_mapping() -> HashMap<&'static str, &'static str> {
//!     let mut mapping = HashMap::new();
//!     mapping.insert(ENTITIES[0].entity, ENTITIES[0].characters);
//!     mapping
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Data was generated from
//! [https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json)
